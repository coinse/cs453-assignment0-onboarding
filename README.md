## CS453 Assignment 0: GitHub Classroom Onboarding

This is a psuedo-assignment that is designed to get you onboard in GitHub classroom. Before you begin, here are some important class-related information.

- CS453 does not allow any use of generative AI models. Do your own thinking and programming. 
- All assignments and reports are to be written and submitted in English.
- Reports should be submitted in PDF format: do not submit raw Markdown files, text files, MS Word files, etc.
- CS453 uses GitHub Classroom to collect assignment deliverables. Assignments should be pushed to the branch `main` (**NOT** `master` or any other branches).
- Do NOT change your GitHub ID that you use for assignments during the semester.
- Late submissions are allowed for one extra week from the deadline, and a penalty multiplier of 0.7 will be applied. Submissions thare are more than one week late will not be graded.

### The Deliverable for this assignment

You need to perform two simple tasks.

- Push a Python Hello World program, `hello.py`.
- Push a text file, `pledge.txt`, which contains your class-related information.

### The Python Program

Your python program should be named `hello.py` and it should print exactly `Hello!` and nothing else (note: no newline). You will get the test results. This is simply to get familiar with reading test results from GitHub Classroom.

### Class-related Information

Your one-line text file should be named `pledge.txt` and should contain the following, in the comma-separated format:

```
I hereby promise that I have read and understood the rules about CS454 contained in the submitted Python program, and that I will follow them.

[Your student ID number], [Your full name in English], [Your email address], [Your GitHub ID], [Your Slack ID]
```

The invitation link to the Slack workspace will be sent out by email. Your Slack ID should be `[Your full name in English] ([Your student ID number])` (note the space between your name and the left parenthesis).

### Reminders

- Allow enough time to push your changes; do not wait until the last minute.
